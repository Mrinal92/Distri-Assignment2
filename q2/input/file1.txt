The forest was vast, stretching endlessly beyond the horizon. The trees stood tall, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind. Among the trees, a small cabin sat nestled in a clearing, a place of both refuge and solitude. The cabin had been abandoned for years, yet its doors remained sturdy, its windows revealing glimpses of the past.

A young traveler named Ethan stumbled upon the cabin during his long journey through the forest. His boots crunched against the fallen leaves as he approached cautiously. The air smelled of damp wood, the scent wrapping around him like an old memory. He had heard tales about this forest, about the cabin, about the strange occurrences that had taken place within its walls.

Despite his hesitation, Ethan reached for the door. The handle was cold beneath his touch, sending a shiver down his spine. He pushed, and the door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit interior. Dust floated in the air, caught in the weak rays of sunlight filtering through the cracked windows.

Inside, the cabin was eerily silent. The walls were lined with old books, their pages yellowed with age. An ancient fireplace stood at the center, its bricks blackened by past flames. The wooden floor creaked under Ethan’s weight as he stepped further inside. A large table sat in the middle of the room, covered in dust and scattered papers.

Curious, Ethan picked up one of the papers. The writing was faded, but he could make out a few words—words that seemed to repeat, over and over again: forest, cabin, door, fireplace, whisper. His heart pounded. Had someone else stood here before him, reading the same words, feeling the same unease?

A sudden gust of wind blew through the cabin, slamming the door shut. Ethan spun around, his eyes darting to the windows. They were still closed. The fireplace, cold and lifeless a moment ago, now had a faint glow within it. He swallowed hard, stepping back towards the door.

Then he heard it—a soft whisper. It was barely audible, like a breath against the walls, a secret carried by the air. The whisper grew louder, forming words he couldn’t understand. He turned towards the fireplace, watching as the faint glow flickered, shifting like a heartbeat.

Something was here. Something unseen.

He reached for the door, but it wouldn’t budge. The handle refused to turn, as if held in place by an invisible force. Panic rose in his chest. He banged against the door, but the cabin seemed to absorb the sound, swallowing his cries into its walls.

The whispering continued. Ethan turned slowly, his gaze sweeping the room. The books on the shelves trembled. The papers on the table fluttered as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The fireplace crackled, though no wood had been placed inside.

Then, the whispers stopped. Silence filled the cabin, pressing down on Ethan like a weight. His breath was loud in the stillness.

And then—three knocks on the door.

Loud. Measured. Certain.

Someone—or something—was outside.

Ethan stood frozen, staring at the door. His mind screamed at him to run, but there was nowhere to go. The windows were too small, the cabin too isolated.

The knocking came again.

One.

Two.

Three.

His hand trembled as he reached for the handle. It was warm now, pulsing beneath his fingers. He hesitated.

The whispering returned, surrounding him, seeping into his bones. The fireplace roared to life, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

Then, as suddenly as it had started, everything stopped.

The fireplace went dark. The whispers vanished. The air grew still.

And the door slowly creaked open on its own.

Beyond it, the forest stretched into the unknown, waiting.
