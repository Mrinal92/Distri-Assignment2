The rain had been falling for hours, drenching the streets in endless puddles. The city was quiet, the usual bustle replaced by the steady rhythm of raindrops against the pavement. In the dim glow of the streetlights, a lone figure moved through the deserted streets, their footsteps echoing in the emptiness. The figure pulled their coat tighter, shielding themselves from the relentless rain.

Every few steps, they glanced over their shoulder, expecting to see something—someone. But the streets remained empty, the only movement coming from the swirling mist that clung to the ground. The figure wasn’t sure why they felt uneasy. The city had always been a place of noise, of life, of constant activity. But tonight, it felt different. Tonight, it felt abandoned.

A distant clock chimed midnight, its deep tolling sound vibrating through the air. The figure hesitated at the sound, their heart pounding. Midnight. They had been walking for far too long. But to where? And why? The rain blurred the edges of the buildings, making everything look distorted, unfamiliar.

They turned a corner, stepping onto a narrow alleyway, their footsteps splashing through shallow puddles. The walls on either side were damp, streaked with years of neglect. A single lamp flickered above, its weak glow barely illuminating the path ahead. Something about this alleyway felt… wrong.

The figure stopped, listening. The rain was still falling, still tapping against the rooftops and the metal of forgotten cars, but beneath it—beneath the sound of the rain, there was something else. A whisper.

They turned sharply, eyes scanning the shadows, but there was nothing. Just the mist, curling around the corners, shifting like something alive. The whisper came again. Faint, barely more than a breath against the rain.

The figure swallowed hard, forcing their feet to move forward. The further they walked into the alleyway, the darker it became. The lamp behind them flickered once, twice, then went out completely.

Darkness.

The whispering grew louder.

The figure quickened their pace, their boots splashing through the puddles, sending ripples through the still water. But the further they went, the longer the alleyway seemed to stretch. It should have ended by now. It should have led to another street, another way out. But it didn’t.

The figure turned around, ready to go back the way they had come.

But the street was gone.

Behind them, there was only more alleyway, stretching endlessly into the darkness.

The rain continued to fall. The whispers continued to murmur.

And the figure finally realized—they were no longer alone.

A shape moved in the mist, just barely visible.

Not one shape.

Many.

The whispers turned into voices.

Soft. Calling.

Welcome.

The figure took a step back. The puddle beneath them rippled. The voices grew louder. The shadows shifted.

They turned. They ran.

But the alleyway never ended. The rain never stopped.

And the voices never, ever let go.
