The house stood alone at the edge of the field, its darkened windows staring like empty eyes. The wind howled through the tall grass, bending it in waves, whispering secrets no one could understand. The sky above was heavy with dark clouds, threatening a storm, but the house remained still, untouched by time.

A young woman named Clara walked slowly toward the house, her shoes sinking slightly into the damp earth. She had been here before. Or had she? The memory tugged at her mind, vague and distant. The door stood slightly ajar, creaking as the wind pushed against it.

She hesitated.

Something about the house felt… wrong.

The windows were covered in dust, yet she could almost feel eyes watching her from inside. The field around her stretched far and empty, but the air carried a strange weight. She stepped forward, her hand trembling as she reached for the door.

The wood was rough beneath her fingers. The wind screamed as if warning her, but she ignored it. The door groaned as she pushed it open, revealing a dimly lit hallway. Dust swirled in the air, disturbed by her presence.

The house smelled of old wood, damp and forgotten. The walls were lined with faded pictures, their faces blurred, distorted by time. She walked slowly, her footsteps echoing in the stillness. A single lightbulb flickered above, casting erratic shadows across the walls.

Then, she heard it.

A faint whisper.

It came from the end of the hallway, just beyond the open doorway leading into the next room.

She stopped.

The whisper came again.

Soft.

Unfamiliar.

Calling her name.

Her heartbeat pounded against her ribs as she stepped toward the doorway. The air grew colder. The shadows stretched longer. The lightbulb flickered faster, like a warning.

She stepped inside.

The room was empty.

Except for the mirror.

It stood tall, its glass fogged, its frame ornate with twisting, curling patterns. The mirror was wrong. It didn’t belong here. And yet, it did.

She stepped closer.

Her reflection stared back at her, but something wasn’t right.

The eyes in the mirror—they weren’t hers.

They blinked.

She didn’t.

Her breath caught in her throat as the whisper came again—this time from inside the mirror.

Not behind her.

Not around her.

Inside.

Her reflection smiled.

She did not.

The lightbulb shattered.

Darkness swallowed the house.

And the whisper became a laugh.
